# About the book

Welcome to **The R torch codebook**.

This book is a consolidated repository of R code for deep learning using the `torch` ecosystem. Unlike traditional textbooks, this is not a theoretical guide. It is designed as a **functional compendium** for practitioners who want to move straight to implementation across diverse data modalities.

### Core Philosophy

The aim of this book is to provide a single, searchable location for all R-based `torch` implementations.

-   **Code-First:** Text is kept to a minimum. The value lies in the executable syntax.

-   **Modality-Driven:** Chapters are organized by data type (Tabular, Image, Audio, Video), reflecting the progression of tensor dimensions and architectural complexity.

-   **Standardized Workflow:** Every analysis follows a consistent logical flow:

    1.  **Dataset Description:** A brief overview of the data used.

    2.  **Objectives:** The specific goal of the deep learning task (e.g., classification, regression).

    3.  **Implementation:** The complete `torch` code required to load data, build the model, and execute training.

### How to Use This Book

This book assumes a working knowledge of the R programming language and a basic understanding of deep learning concepts (like backpropagation and gradient descent).

Readers are encouraged to:

1.  **Search by Modality:** Use the sidebar to find the data type relevant to your project.

2.  **Adapt the Recipes:** Copy the code blocks and swap the dataset description/loader with your own local data.

3.  **Cross-Reference:** Observe how `torch` handles different tensor dimensions as you move from Tabular (2D) to Video (5D) data.

### Technical Stack

All examples are built using the latest versions of the following R packages:

-   **`torch`**: The core tensor and autograd library.

-   **`luz`**: High-level API for model training and management.

-   **`torchvision` / `torchaudio`**: Specialized utilities for imaging and signal processing.
